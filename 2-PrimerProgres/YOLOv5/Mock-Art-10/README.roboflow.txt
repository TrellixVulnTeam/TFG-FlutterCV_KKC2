* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels
